    Kid comes home from school;
    he's failing algebra.
    His mother is verklempt.
    She can't believe it.
    She's heartbroken.
    
    She goes to synagogue
    and a guy sees her there.
    She looks terrible;
    guy sez, "You look terrible!
    What's wrong?"
    
    She sez, "Oy! Do you know
    anyone who's an algebra tutor?"
    
    "Algebra tutor?!"
    The guy's incredibly surprised.
    "Are you kidding me?
    <i>I'm</i> an algebra tutor."
    
    "<i>You're</i> an algebra tutor."
    
    "I'll tell ya what kinda tutor I am,
    I'm not just <i>some</i> algebra tutor,
    you wanna know what kinda tutor I am?
    Last year, my cousin's kid got
    shot in the head - lost both his eyes;
    has to breathe through a tube.
    Six months tutorin' with me,
    he's got an A <i>plus</i>, in algebra two."

    "That's a_MAY_zing!"
    
    "That's amazing? That's <i>nothing</i>.
    I'll tell you what kinda tutor I am,
    alright? My uncle runs the fish monger
    on Third, right? Couple-a years ago,
    one of his shipments of salmon had
    <i>barnacle</i> encrustations all over it;
    we scraped 'em off the fish.
    Three months later, I got one-a those
    little barnacles to
    <i>pass the A.P. calculus exam</i>."
    
    "Thats in_CRED_ible!" she sez.
    She can't believe it. She's so excited.
    "Well, do you think you could
    help my son pass algebra?"
    
    Guy sez, "<i>Your</i> son?... oooooow."

    Here's that same story:
<hr>

<pre>
    
    Guy's wandering through the desert.
    He sees God sitting over on a rock.
    He walks up to him and
    God looks just horrible.
    He sez, "Hey God, what's wrong?"
    
    "Oy, vey! I'm looking for a prophet."
    
    "A prophet?"
    
    "Yeah, a prophet."
    
    "<i>I'm</i> a prophet!"
    
    God gets excited, "You're a prophet?"
    
    "Sure I'm a prophet, you don't even know.
    You wanna know what kinda prophet I am?
    I'll tell ya what kinda prophet I am.
    I went down to Africa - you know Africa?
    There's guys down there
    eatin' bugs, fuckin' giraffes, worshiping idols;
    it's out-a control...
    I'm in Africa <i>six months</i>?
    I got a whole city to keep kosher;
    they're wearin' peyot; they keep the sabbath;
    everything."
    
    God sez, "That's a_MAY_zing!"
    
    "Amazing? That's <i>nothing</i>.
    You should know what a prophet I am!
    Lemme tell ya.
    I crossed the sea, the big ocean,
    I went to the New World.
    You know it? Crazy, right?
    There's guys over there
    sacrificing virgins, drinkin' blood,
    buildin' pyramids, dancin' with corn;
    it's ridiculous what abominations
    those people are!
    I'm in Mexico like <i>three months</i>,
    I got the entire Aztec empire to <i>convert</i>.
    They're circumcised, they're wearin' kippahs,
    they don't eat pig, and they care for the orphans.
    It's beautiful."
    
    "That's in_CRED_ible!" God is so impressed.
    He sez, "Well, do you think you could be
    a prophet for the children of Israel?"
    
    The prophet sez, "<i>Israel</i>? oooooow..."
