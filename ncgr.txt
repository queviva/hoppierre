cave antibiotic resistance - this is SHARED!!!

teaching notes describes everything

case-study is highest priority

make a glossary at end of teaching notes
breifly defining werds in blue and other terms
probably before references section

time class activities - how long does it take
and can you do it from the instructions


glossary :::

spelunking: A highly specific term for simply exploring a cave.

antibiotic resistance: The tendency for bacteria to acquire
    a tolerance for medicines that formerly killed them.

pangenomics: Within genetics, a field focused on the study of
    the set of genes from all individuals in a larger group.
    From _pan_ meaning "all" and _genome_.

de Bruijn graph: A representation of symbols connected by arrows,
    where the symbols indicate short overlapping sequences and
    the arrows indicate possible directions in which to assemble
    the individual symbols into a final combined element.

protozoa: Incredibly small, animal-like, single-celled life forms
    possessing at least one nucleus and living either individually
    or in colonies. From _proto_ "first" [see _prototype_] and
    _zoa_ "animal [see _zoo_]."

archaea: Old things, specifically single-celled, prokaryotitc
    microorganisms which do _not_ have a nucleus. Originally referred
    only to such organisms that existed in extreme environs.
    From _archaea_ "old things" [see _archaic_, or _archaeology_].

phyla: More than one _phylum_, a division of a taxonomic Kingdom.

microbiome: The group of all microscopic organism living in a
    particular place.

antibiotics: Any of a group of medicines specifically intended to
    kill bacteria or other pathogenic life forms.

Ignaz Semmelweiss: Known for advocating, in the 1840s and later,
    the idea of hand-washing and cleanliness to prevent the
    transmission of disease in hospitals.

Joseph Lister: Known for promoting, in the 1850s and later,
    antiseptic techniques and sterilization of surgical instruments
    to prevent infection.

germ theory: The idea, prior to the invention of microscopes,
    that diseases originated from insivibly small "germs" invading
    a host and then developing until they caused the symptoms
    of a disease. From _germ_ "seed" [see _germinate_].
    
Paul Ehrlich: Known for creating a method of staining things to
    make them distinguishable under a microscope and for
    discovering a cure for syphilis.

syphilis: A transmissible bacterial infection that may cause
    various debilitating symptoms, now curable with antibiotics.
    From _Syphilis_ the name of a character in a story.

Alexander Fleming: Known for discovering penicillin and promoting
    its use as an antibiotic medical treatment.

penicillin:
    From _penicillus_ "paintbrush" [see _pencil_].

pathogenic: Something that causes disease.
    From _pathos_ "disease" and _genic_ "generating."

Constable Albert Alexander

staphylococcus:

Anne Miller:
    From _hannah_ "grace" and _miller_ "person who operates a mill"

Howard Florey
Ernst Chain

antimicrobials: The larger class of medicines intended to kill or
    hinder microbes, of which antibiotics are one.

broad/narrow spectrum:

eukaryotes:

beta-lactam:

bacteriostatic:

macrolides:

quinoline:

resistance genes: The specific short sequences within DNA responsible
    for creating the traits that protect organisms from antibiotics.

genetic mutations: Alterations in DNA code.

superbug:

MRSA:

horizontal/lateral gene transfer

transformation

bacterial conjugation

transduction

gene mobilization

lechugilla: spanish for "little lettuce girl"

Paenibacillus

kinase encoding

evolutionary pressure

streptogramin
