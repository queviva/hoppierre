People love messing with the things they like.
And if you want to <i>seriously</i> mess with something,
what better way than <i>altering its DNA</i>?
<br><br>

People who do this a lot - or at least often enough
to consider it their profession - call themselves
<i>geneticists</i>, and expect everyonelse to call
what they do <i>genetic engineering</i>.
<br><br>

Now, most of the time, this 'engineering' results
from some fairly haphazard techniques - in fact,
you know that DNA even mutates randomly all on its
own (and that formed the basis of what you learned
about evolution).
<br><br>

"But, <i>what if</i> ..." say these geneticists
to themselves, "what if we could make
<i>precise and acurate</i> alterations to DNA?
We could <i>really</i> screw with things then!"
<br><br>

At this point, engineers typically <i>invent</i>
something to do what they want - but in keeping
with geneticist's style, they decided to literally
just <i>stumble upon an enzyme that already does this</i>.
Lucky for them, that happened!
Let's call that enzyme <i>Cas9</i>.
<br><br>

More specifically, this enzyme has the ability
to unwrap strands of DNA, match a specific part,
and then cut the DNA at that exact location.
Combined with some other 'self-healing'
abilities of DNA, geneticsts developed a method
of making very precise genetic edits.
<br><br>

How precise? Well, you already know that DNA
essentially consists of a HUGE list of <i>letters</i>;
matching pairs of G, A, T, & C, over and over again,
millions and millions of them, in a specific order,
known as a <i>sequence</i>, that 'spells out' the
definition of an organism.

CRISPR-Cas9 would allow you to change <i>one letter</i>
in an exact position, from that enormous sequence.
<br><br>

at the entrance to a mall.
</i>
</div>

The Cas9 enzyme - a sort-of molecular blob - has
a little piece of RNA (basically a short, one-sided,
piece of DNA) stuck inside it. That small sequence
of RNA <i>guides</i> the enzyme to a matching,
complimentary, <i>target location</i> in the full
DNA strand, where it then splices the DNA.
<br><br>

In nature, that guide comes from a previous
viral infection and has the effect in bacteria
of preventing repeat infections.

Geneticists discovered that if you
replace the little strand of guide-RNA with
one you have <i>designed yourself</i>,
Cas9 will make its cut in the postion you want
instead.
<br><br>

Brilliant!
<br><br>

Except, ofcourse, that's not what happens;
why <i>would</i> it be?
<br><br>

The process of matching complimentary portions
of the DNA sequence contains a LOT more sloppy
guessing than how you see it depicted in most
edutainment. Remember that DNA only has four
different letters to choose from; so out of the
billions of <i>base pairs</i> in the sequence,
a lot of parts will look similar. If there were
only four notes, most songs would have parts
that sounded a lot like other songs.
<br><br>

Ultimately, Cas9 might end up landing a little
<i>off-target</i>, in some place that matches
the guide <i>enough</i>, but not exactly.
The enzyme works, the RNA guide has the right
letters, in the correct order, the lab is the
right temperature and humidity, but the Cas9
attaches to places in the DNA where the sequence
only matches, say, eighty-five percent of the
guide.
<br><br>

Off-targets cause a few <i>severe</i> problems,
maybe deactivation of vital genes, or even
cancerous mutations. So, obviously, geneticists
really want to avoid off-targets, right?
<br><br>

<i>Wrong.</i>
<br><br>

No, what they want to do is: <i>predict the
likelihood of it happening</i>.  Remember,
pretty liberal definition of the word 'engineer'
being used here.

    An enzyme blob uses a little RNA tail
    to cut DNA in precise locations,
    but misses its target sometimes.
    <br><br>
    Geneticists want to know how likely
    it is to miss.
</div>
<br>

How do they do this?
<br><br>

A few different ways, one of which is <i><b>not</b></i>
the following method because, ofcourse,
this is supposed to be a description of a
<i>new method</i> of doing it.
<br><br>

Geneticists have developed a version of Cas9
that still binds to a precise location
but does not cut the strands of DNA.
This <i>dead</i> Cas9 might also have a
<i>green flourescing protein</i> attached
to it. That way you can add Cas9
complexes to different samples and see them
under a special light.

    background-color:#888;
    xbackground: linear-gradient(#888, #000);
    margin:20px 20px 0px 0px;
" align="left">

Now, you probably did not know that these
enzymes gradually <i>deteriorate</i>, over time,
in different ways. If a complex fails to bind to
a target site at all, it will dissipate into the
rest of the cell rather quickly. If a complex
does bind, it will still get destroyed
when the DNA replicates, but that takes longer
to happen. By measuring the amount of glow
coming from each sample, at different times,
you can get an idea of the <i>rate</i> at which
the enzymes deteriorate and give yourself
a fairly good idea of your complex's affinity
for off-targets. But why?
<br><br>
<i>Because there are more ways to be wrong than there are
to be right.</i>
Remember, that Cas9 only has <i>one</i> actual target.
All of the off-targets would create <i>excess binds</i>
and, therefore, more glowing portions on the strand
of DNA.

From the graph you see that, initially, all samples had
high levels of flourescence because the Cas9+GFP had
just been added. The samples with high percentages of
off-targets continued to have high levels of flourescence
for longer while the most accurate sample dropped off quickly.
<br><br>

Ultimately, "our results confirm our dCas9-GFP assay as a
versatile approach to effectively evaluating off-targets
for any guide crRNA under functionally comparable conditions
prior [to] CRISPR gene editing."
